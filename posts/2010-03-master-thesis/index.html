<p>Master Thesis, University of Z√ºrich</p>
<p>Poker offers an interesting domain to investigate some fundamental problems in artificial intelligence. The properties of stochasticity and imperfect information pose new challenging questions, not present in other typical game research subjects like chess; traditional methods for computer game-playing as alpha-beta search are incapable of handling these challenges.</p>
