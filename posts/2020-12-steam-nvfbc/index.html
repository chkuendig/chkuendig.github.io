    <span>ðŸ’¡</span>
    <p><strong>FYI:</strong> I only got the magic values <a href="https://github.com/trevor403/get-priv-data-gfe">extracted from GFE</a> and the ones in nvidia-patch to work, the ones <a href="https://github.com/trevor403/get-priv-data/">extracted from Windows Steam</a> didn&rsquo;t. Not sure if that means anything or is a red herring.</p>
</aside>
<p>After all of this, I&rsquo;m pretty sure my setup is compatible with NvFBC. Now the question was figuring out why steam didn&rsquo;t work. So I tried two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Checked for any references in any of the steam binaries - there&rsquo;s no references to <code>libnvidia-fbc</code> - only <code>libnvidia-encode</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LD_PRELOAD</code> both 32bit and 64 binaries to catch any calls to <code>nvFBCCreateInstance</code> and <code>nvFBCCreateHandle</code> (to set the correct magic values).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> I had to build a small library to preload before steam which I shared on <a href="https://gist.github.com/chkuendig/fc26f4fe0b378012c697fd46dad1a73d">Github Gist</a>:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chkuendig/fc26f4fe0b378012c697fd46dad1a73d.js"></script>
</p>
<p>These calls never happen (and I also tested this against the unchanged <code>NvFBCToGLEnc</code> sample where preloading worked to inject the magic values ) - so my conclusion is that Steam on Linux probably doesn&rsquo;t support NvFBC.</p>
<p><em>Caveat: Since this feature always included some undocumented Nvidia APIs and magic values, it&rsquo;s possible that this has been obfuscated enough to slip through my experiments&hellip; Please let me know if you notice anything I might have missed</em></p>
