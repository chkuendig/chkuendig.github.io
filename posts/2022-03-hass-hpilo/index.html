<p>I have been using a HP Microserver for a few years as my home lab and quite enjoy it. Unfortunately Home Assistant&rsquo;s existing <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hp_ilo">HP Integrated Lights-Out (ILO) integration</a> is very limited and does not have any configuration integration. I have started working on an updated version of this integration. For the initial release, I focused on three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-Discovery with config flow so no <code>configuration.yaml</code> editing will be required.</li>
<li>Support for as many sensor types automatically out of the box.</li>
<li>Updating <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-hpilo/">python-hpilo</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
<p>For Auto Discovery to work, it has to be enabled in the iLO admin UI:
<img loading="lazy" src="/posts/2022-03-hass-hpilo/screenshot_ilo_discovery.png" type="" alt="ILO Screenshot"  /></p>
<p>For development &amp; testing it also makes sense to set the interval low enough (default seems to be 10min)</p>
<p>ILO servers are announcing themselves on a few of SSDP search targets:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:Basic:1</code> with details at <code>http://[IP]/upnp/BasicDevice.xml</code> (this implements the <a href="http://upnp.org/specs/basic/UPnP-basic-Basic-v1-Device.pdf">UPnP
Basic:1.0 Device Definition</a> standard ). Luckily Home Assistant already implements this as part of the existing SSDP discovery mechanism.</li>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>The goal is to implement a clean config flow supporting a few things:</p>

<li>Update of IPs and Hostname from discovery in case any of them change.</li>

<p><strong>This component will set up the following platforms.</strong></p>

<p>The existing sensors only implement the sensor entity. Ideally a few more things would be nice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically generate all supported entities automatically.</li>
<li>Device entity with as much information as possile about the system configuration</li>
<li>Binary sensor for firmware update status, power</li>
<li>Buttons for <a href="https://seveas.github.io/python-hpilo/firmware.html">Firmware upgrades</a> and <a href="https://seveas.github.io/python-hpilo/power.html">reboots/restarts</a> etc.</li>
<li>Switches for Power on/Off</li>
<li>Fan entities for fans</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s already two PRs to improve on this:   <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65900" data-icon="octicon-git-pull-request-closed" data-size="small" data-text='core#65900: <span style="font-weight:normal">Add statistics capabilities to hp_ilo integration</span>'></a> and   <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/32209" data-icon="octicon-git-pull-request-closed" data-size="small" data-text='core#32209: <span style="font-weight:normal">Add switch platform for hp ilo integration</span>'></a> so I&rsquo;ll see where these go as well and then update the integration.</p>
<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>
<p>Startup and refresh is currently not optimized, slowing this integration down quite a bit. It also seems that data isn&rsquo;t shared between sensors, meaning the rate limiting is resulting in very coarse grained data once there&rsquo;s more then a handful of sensors active.</p>
<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually no tests at all in Home Assistant for this component right now.
Most features should be able to be tested with the existing mock data in <code>python-hpilo</code>.</p>
