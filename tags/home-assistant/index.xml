      <description>I have been using a HP Microserver for a few years as my home lab and quite enjoy it. Unfortunately Home Assistant&amp;rsquo;s existing HP Integrated Lights-Out (ILO) integration is very limited and does not have any configuration integration. I have started working on an updated version of this integration. For the initial release, I focused on three things:
Auto-Discovery with config flow so no configuration.yaml editing will be required. Support for as many sensor types automatically out of the box.</description>
