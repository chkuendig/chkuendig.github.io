      <description>The yearly hackathon at work is always a great time to pursue new ideas or play around in fun ways with existing technology. My entry in 2019 was a humorous take on using simulations when developing computer vision software. I long wondered to see if we could use modern game engines or other simulation technology to augment some of our real world testing at scale.
For the hackathon, I decided to apply my (as you will see quite limited) skills and implement a prototype of such a system.</description>

      <title>BrowsePass fork with Dropbox support</title>

      <description>Living and traveling overseas for more than a year, I want a way to access some of my more secure credentials in case of device loss.
BrowsePass is a static web application to read KDBX files as produced by KeePass. This allows me to securely access my passwords and logins from everywhere - all I need is a computer with a web browser.
As Google isn&amp;rsquo;t available in all the countries I&amp;rsquo;m traveling to (ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³), I added support for Dropbox to it.</description>
